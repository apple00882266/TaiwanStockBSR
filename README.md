StealStockWealth
================

This's something to do for me. 
Python practice. 
collect Taiwan Stock Exchange information toolkit. 

using module 
	BeautifulSoup - http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/ 

usage:

	install BeautifulSoup
	
	python GetTWSE.py
	
	and wait csv download in BSR folder.
	
Todo.

	1. maybe using 're' replace BeautifulSoup
	2. add OTC information.
	3. csv to db
	4. Web GUI...
